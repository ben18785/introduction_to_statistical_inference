# introduction_to_statistical_inference
This is a half-day course aimed at providing a short introduction to statistical inference. In it, we cover:

- why do we need statistics?
- how regression models work and different approaches for fitting these models
- model diagnostics for linear regression
- estimating uncertainty in predictions using bootstrap sampling
- can statistics help to determine causation?

The lecture notes for this course are [here](./presentations/introduction_to_statistical_inference.pdf).

The [problem set](./problem_sets/wine.ipynb) for this course mirrors the lecture content and works through a regression analysis of [wine data](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
The answers for this problem set are available [here](./problem_sets/answers/wine.ipynb).
